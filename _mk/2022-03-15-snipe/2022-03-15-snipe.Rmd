Today was a good day for Mario Kart. The post below summarizes my stream snipe of Clint Stevens and my new speedrunning PB.

```{r}
err <- results %>% 
  filter(Clint == "e")

overall <- results %>% 
  filter(Clint != "e") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = Clint:Goio,
               names_to = "racer",
               values_to = "result") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(result)) %>% 
  mutate(race = as.numeric(race),
         result = as.numeric(result),
         racer = as.factor(racer))

mar15 <- overall %>% 
  filter(date == "2022-03-15")

snp <- mar15 %>% 
  filter(racer != "Clint")

clint <- mar15 %>% 
  filter(racer == "Clint")
```

## Stream Snipe

### Mario Kart streams to date

Clint hosted his 4th Mario Kart stream of 2022 on March 15th. He played 56 games, his most so far this year.

```{r}
ggYTD <- overall %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(races = max(race)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=races, fill=factor(races))) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 60, by = 15)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Greens") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x="Stream Date", y="Games Played",
       fill="# of Games")

ggplotly(ggYTD)
```

### Tracks Played

Hyrule Circuit and Mount Wario were the most frequently played tracks of the day, each played 4 times.

```{r}
trkFqTYD <- overall %>% 
  filter(racer == "Clint") %>% 
  count(trk) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(fq = round(n/sum(n)*100, 2),
         trk = as.factor(trk))

trkFq <- clint %>%  
  count(trk) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(fq = round(n/sum(n)*100, 2),
         trk = as.factor(trk)) %>% 
  left_join(trkFqTYD, by = "trk") %>% 
  left_join(tracks) %>% 
  select(track, n.x, fq.x, n.y, fq.y) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(track))

datatable(trkFq, 
          filter = 'top', 
          caption = "Most frequent tracks",
          colnames = c("Track", 
                       "Races Today", 
                       "Frequency",
                       "YTD",
                       "Fq"),
          options = list(pageLength = 6))

```

### Connection errors

The games were marred by connection problems. Five times during the stream, Clint was kicked out of the lobby before the race finished. Snipers scrambled into the new lobbies, but sometimes it took a few games for spots to open.

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2, fig.align='center'}
snpCtRace <- mar15 %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  count()

ggplot(snpCtRace, aes(x=race, y=n)) +
  geom_step() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 2)) +
  labs(x="Race #",
       y="Snipers in game")
```

The results of one game were also affected by connection issues. During the 48th race, Royal Raceway, I saw Clint pass me in a bullet bill shortly before the finish line. His result originally showed a 6th place finish, but after a long moment of lag his result changed to 8th. However, this is not what I saw during my recording.

![](images/glitched-score.png)

Notice that not only are the results different for those in 5th-11th, but so are the Elo rankings. So I looked back to the Elo rankings for the next race, to see who's screen showed the true results.

![](images/correct-elo.png)

The Elo rankings for the next race matched my results on both of our screens, so I used those for the dataset. The results are: 5th--Moonmoon (BatChest), 6th--Clint, 7th--Sarah, 8th--gamergirl, 9th--kaleighboo, 10th--Jim, and 11th--Dylan.

### March 15 Snipers

The following table shows snipers who completed at least 5 races.

```{r}
snpFq <- snp %>% 
  count(racer) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  filter(n > 4) 

snpYTDFq <- overall %>% 
  count(racer) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  filter(n > 4) 

snpFq %>% 
  left_join(snpYTDFq, by = "racer") %>% 
  datatable(caption = "March 15 Snipers",
            colnames = c("Sniper", "Races completed", "YTD"),
          options = list(pageLength = 13))
```

Three racers made their first appearance of 2022: Dylan, kaleighboo, and gamergirl. Dylan also played the most races with Clint, at 36.

### Results

The next two graphs show data for Clint and the eight most frequent snipers. I'd like to include more people, but the graphs get busy quickly.

The first graph show the number of nth place finishes for each player.

```{r}
#' this actually works. need to rearrange stuff.
vC8 <- c("Clint", 
         "Dawn", 
         "pokimane", 
         "BatChest", 
         "gamergirl",
         "Sarah", 
         "DylanTonn", 
         "Peter", 
         "kaleighboo"
         ) 

vC8c <- vC8 %>% str_c(collapse = "|")

C8 <- mar15 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(racer, vC8c))

C8$racer <- factor(C8$racer, levels = vC8)

ggC8 <- C8 %>% ggplot(aes(x=result, fill=racer)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, by = 1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x="Result", y="Count", fill="Player")

ggplotly(ggC8)
```

Dawn had more first place finishes than anyone else, followed by Clint. Dawn, Clint, and pokimane tied for the most top-3 finishes (14).

Overall I was much happier with my placement, especially considering [my first time playing](https://sarah.fyi/mk/2022-03-08-snipe/). In that stream I never placed above 5th; tonight I had 5 top-3 results. I'm also the only sniper to have placed at least once in every result.

#### Average results

The graph below show the smoothed average result for each racer over the course of the night. Double click on a name in the legend to isolate the line. Single click to hide/show a racer.

```{r, layout="l-page", fig.height=5}
ggResult <- C8 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = race, y = result, color = racer, fill = racer)) +
  geom_smooth(alpha = 0.15) +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks = seq(1, 12, by = 2)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Smoothed average result for racers, March 15, 2022",
       x = "Race #",
       y = "Result",
       color = "Player",
       fill = NULL)

ggplotly(ggResult)
```

Dawn and pokimane consistently averaged above Clint over the night.

In my last game, I averaged between 8th and 9th place, while today I averaged a 7.04, a significant improvement. I had a slow start, but over time my average briefly surpassed Clint. Batchest also overcame Clint in the latter half of the races.

### Rankings

The table below takes the average score for each player and assigns them a ranking.

```{r}
snpAvg <- mar15 %>% 
  group_by(racer) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(result),
            plays = n()) %>% 
  filter(plays > 4) %>% 
  arrange(avg) 

snpRank <- snpAvg %>% 
  mutate(rank = case_when(
    avg < 4 ~ "S",
    avg < 4.5 ~ "A+",
    avg < 5 ~ "A",
    avg < 5.5 ~ "A-",
    avg < 6 ~ "B+",
    avg < 6.5 ~ "B",
    avg < 7 ~ "B-",
    avg < 7.5 ~ "C+",
    avg < 8 ~ "C",
    avg < 8.5 ~ "C-",
    avg < 9 ~ "D+",
    avg < 9.5 ~ "D",
    avg < 10 ~ "D-",
    TRUE ~ "F"
  ),
  avg = round(avg, 2)) %>% 
  arrange(avg) %>% 
  mutate(racer = as.factor(racer),
         rank = as.factor(rank))
```

```{r}
overallAvg <- overall %>% 
  group_by(racer) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(result),
            plays = n()) %>% 
  filter(plays > 4) %>% 
  arrange(avg) 

overallRank <- overallAvg %>% 
  mutate(rank = case_when(
    avg < 4 ~ "S",
    avg < 4.5 ~ "A+",
    avg < 5 ~ "A",
    avg < 5.5 ~ "A-",
    avg < 6 ~ "B+",
    avg < 6.5 ~ "B",
    avg < 7 ~ "B-",
    avg < 7.5 ~ "C+",
    avg < 8 ~ "C",
    avg < 8.5 ~ "C-",
    avg < 9 ~ "D+",
    avg < 9.5 ~ "D",
    avg < 10 ~ "D-",
    TRUE ~ "F"
  ),
  avg = round(avg, 2)) %>% 
  arrange(avg) %>% 
  mutate(racer = as.factor(racer),
         rank = as.factor(rank))

snpRank %>% 
  left_join(overallRank, by = "racer") %>% 
  select(racer, avg.x, rank.x, avg.y, rank.y) %>% 
  datatable(colnames = c("Racer", "Today's Average", "Today's Rank", "Overall Average", "Overall Rank"),
            caption = "Racer Rankings",
          options = list(pageLength = 14))

```

After getting [ranked D+](https://sarah.fyi/mk/2022-03-11-snipe-guide/#sniper-rankings) by my own system, I'm happy with my C+ gameplay today.

## Highlights

There were multiple moments during my last stream sniper where I wish I had recorded my POV and reaction. I don't think my internet could currently handle stream sniping (nor am I sure I want to), so I just recorded it locally. For the record, I forgot to adjust my settings to record at a higher quality, and I'm still figuring out picture-in-picture layouts and when to cut.

### Guilty

Only Clint and Moonmoon were ahead of me going into the final turn of the first lap of Ice Ice Outpost. I missed the mushroom skip, but Moonmoon ran into the wall and Clint went far left. I decided to use my sound box before the finish line to give myself a solid first into the second lap. I knew I tapped him, but I didn't realize he'd been hurtled over the side until I caught the replay on his stream.

### Play of the Game

Cloudtop Cruise is usually one of my least favorite maps, but yesterday I nailed the mirrored version. Halfway through the second lap, Clint was in first and I was in second. A blue shell nailed him just before the jump into the cloud tunnel. I stayed far to the right, avoiding the blast radius, and I zoomed far into first. On the final lap I was blue shelled in nearly the same spot, allowing the pack to catch up with me.

In the final stretch, Dylan's bullet bill pushed him ahead of Clint and then myself. Just before risking the final shortcut, Dylan threw away his entire defense. I let go of my red shell and the timing was perfect, causing Dylan to fall halfway through the jump. I finished third, Clint finished fourth.

Sorry Dylan.

## Speedrunning PB [1:58:38]

After some solid online play, I wasn't ready to put away Mario Kart for the day just yet. I decided to start a speedrun around 5AM and it began horrendously. However, massive time saves on Ice Ice Outpost and Animal Crossing saved me huge time. You can watch the speedrun [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1426307055).

### Future time saves

-   Thwomp Ruins: ran into pillar at end of water section on 2nd lap

-   Toad Harbor: 1st lap - ran into wall at end of awning section; 2nd lap - hit every barrel under awning

-   Twisted Mansion: tapped into hammer on 2nd lap

-   Mount Wario: Ran into boulder in cave section

-   Bone Dry Dunes: Got chomped on first lap

-   Rainbow Road: Fall in first turn

-   Cheep Cheep Beach: ran into wall at end of beach section on final lap

-   Toad's Turnpike: ran into railing a lot

-   Dry Dry Dunes: very low on coins entire race

-   Donut Plains 3: gopher run in

-   Royal Raceway: ran off in final turn section

-   Wario Stadium & Dragon Driftway: AI ran me into wall at v beginning

-   Sherbet Land: trouble with columns in underwater section

-   Music Park: made the shortcut but v messy

-   Piranha Plant Slide: ran into goomba

-   Neo Bowser City: fell on tricky turn final lap

-   Ribbon Road: fell on 2nd ramp first lap
